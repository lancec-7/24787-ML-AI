# 24787---ML-AI

This project aims to utilize our knowledge in ML to understand and predict CO and NOX emmsions from Gas Turbines. 
Our goal is to build our machine learning model and compare our performance with the algorithm proposed in the paper, 
and a couple of other famous algorithms like random forest, logistic regression, etc.

Detailed description is in the project proposal.
